## About Tracker

Tracker is a runtime security and observability tool that helps you understand how your system and applications behave.  
It is using [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/) to tap into your system and expose that information as events that you can consume.  
Events range from factual system activity events to sophisticated security events that detect suspicious behavioral patterns.

To learn more about Tracker, check out the [documentation](https://khulnasoft-lab.github.io/tracker/). 

## Quickstart
